# Get Zero Install

Visit https://get.0install.net/ to download Zero Install for your operating system.

This repository contains the source code for that website.

## Bootstrap

[bootstrap/](bootstrap/) contains a simple PHP script that creates bootstrapping EXEs or bash scripts for installing Zero Install and then running a feed.

Links to the deployed instance of this script are automatically generated by the default feed stylesheet used by [0repo](https://github.com/0install/0repo).

The script takes the following HTTP GET parameters:
 * `name` (required): The name of the application described by the feed.
 * `uri` (required): The URI of the feed.
 * `mode` (optional): `run` (default) or `integrate`

### How it works

The scripts loads a template file based on the user agent's operating system, substitutes placeholders with the parameters and returns the file as the response.

#### Linux
`run.sh.template` and `integrate.sh.template` are shell scripts that first tries to detect the distribution's package manager, then uses it to install Zero Install and finally invokes `0install run` or `0install add` for the target feed.
The script contains placeholders that are replaced by the PHP script.

#### Windows
The [Zero Install for Windows Bootstrapper executable](https://docs.0install.net/details/windows/#bootstrapper) contains placeholders that are replaced by the PHP script.
