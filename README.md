# 0bootstrap-php
Simple PHP script that creates bootstrapping EXEs or bash scripts for installing Zero Install and then running a feed.

An instance of the script is hosted at https://0install.de/bootstrap/. Links to this are automatically generated by the default feed stylesheet used by [0repo](https://github.com/0install/0repo).

The script takes the following HTTP GET parameters:
 * `name` (required): The name of the application described by the feed.
 * `uri` (required): The URI of the feed.
 * `mode` (optional): `run` (default) or `integrate`

## How it works

The scripts loads a template file based on the user agent's operating system, substitutes placeholders with the parameters and returns the file as the response.

### Linux
`run.sh.template` and `integrate.sh.template` are shell scripts that first tries to detect the distribution's package manager, then uses it to install Zero Install and finally invokes `0install run` or `0install add` for the target feed.
The script contains placeholders that are replaced by the PHP script.

### Windows
Clone https://github.com/0install/0install-win, run `build.ps1` and copy `artifacts\Bootstrap\zero-install\zero-install.exe` into this directory.
This executable contains placeholders that are replaced by the PHP script.
